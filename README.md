## 📦 Installation
Install YOLO Trainer easily via pip:
```sh
pip install yolotrainer
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start
Train your YOLO model in just a few lines of code:

```python
from yolotrainer import YOLOTrainer

# Initialize trainer
trainer = YOLOTrainer(
    dataset_path="path/to/dataset",
    model_version="yolov8",
    epochs=50
)

# Start training
trainer.train()
```

---

## 📂 Dataset Structure
Ensure your dataset follows the YOLO annotation format:
```
/dataset
  /images
    /train
    /val
  /labels
    /train
    /val
```

---

## ⚙️ Custom Configuration
Fine-tune your training process with customizable parameters:
```python
trainer = YOLOTrainer(
    dataset_path="path/to/dataset",
    model_version="yolov5",
    batch_size=16,
    epochs=100,
    learning_rate=0.001
)
```

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
Evaluate your trained model with built-in evaluation tools:
```python
trainer.evaluate()
```

---

## 🖼️ Visualizing Results
Gain insights into your model’s performance with easy visualization:
```python
trainer.visualize_results()
```

---

## ⚡ GPU Acceleration
For faster training, ensure your system has a CUDA-compatible GPU and install the necessary dependencies:
```sh
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```
